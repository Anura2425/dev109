    <main>
        <h3>1) What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Prior to this class I had little knowledge in HTML and CSS, however I had used Javascript for a couple of personal projects and at my previous job to teach kids how to code through developing video games.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2) Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch and why?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For my final project I used a template because I was struggling with thinking where to start and having a template gave me some ideas and a good starting point to work off of.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>3) What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I think the most challenging part for me was setting up the style at the start (CSS). Due to my use of a template, instead of writing all of the CSS code from scratch I spent most of the time at the start editing the code from the template, which took a bit of extra time because I needed to get familiar with how the template was set up. Once I figured it out it wasn't too bad.
          </li>
          <li>
            The other challenge I had was with the validators. Due to the portfolio requiring multiple html files for all of the pages, there were a lot more checks and little mistakes I made while switching between files so that ended up taking a decent amount of time to fix.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>4) How did this class change your view on Web Development?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This class gave me a deeper level of respect for all of the hard work that goes into Web Development, even some designs that may seem simple take so much more time and effort to get right than you might expect.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>5) What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
             Don't be afraid to use the internet for help. There are so many good resources for learning if you are ever stuck or have questions that you can find with a quick google search. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Make projects your own. What I mean by this is even if you are following a tutorial or step-by-step, make some changes to make your version unique as you will retain information way better that way and also maybe learn something extra on top of what the guide/project is teaching you.
